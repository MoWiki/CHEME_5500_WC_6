# Rock Climbing 
## Techniques and Moves

1. Keep arms as striaght as possible, as often as possible. 
2. Keep center of gravity of your body as close to the wall as possible. Hug your hips to the wall. 
3. Plan your moves well before you make them. Your eyes should not be on the hold you are currently holding, but on your next hold. 
4. Don't be embarrased to take breaks. BUT, do not take breaks while you are hanging your weight. 
5. Focus on using your leg muscles to hold yourself on each hold.
